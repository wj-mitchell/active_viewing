However, unlike explicit emotion regulation techniques, affect labeling may not even feel like a regulatory process as it occurs. Nevertheless, research investigating affect labeling has found it produces a pattern of effects like those seen during explicit emotion regulation, suggesting affect labeling is a form of implicit emotion regulation. In this review, we will outline research on affect labeling, comparing it to reappraisal, a form of explicit emotion regulation, along four major domains of effects—experiential, autonomic, neural, and behavioral—that establish it as a form of implicit emotion regulation. This review will then speculate on possible mechanisms driving affect labeling effects and other remaining unanswered questions.},

	abstract = {Although multiple neuroimaging studies suggest that affect labeling (i.e., putting feelings into words) can dampen affect-related responses in the amygdala, the consequences of affect labeling have not been examined in other channels of emotional responding. We conducted four studies examining the effect of affect labeling on self-reported emotional experience. In study one, self-reported distress was lower during affect labeling, compared to passive watching, of negative emotional pictures. Studies two and three added reappraisal and distraction conditions, respectively. Affect labeling showed similar effects on self-reported distress as both of these intentional emotion regulation strategies. In each of the first three studies, however, participant predictions about the effects of affect labeling suggest that unlike reappraisal and distraction, people do not believe affect labeling to be an effective emotion regulation strategy. Even after having the experience of affect labels leading to lower distress, participants still predicted that affect labeling would increase distress in the future. Thus, affect labeling is best described as an incidental emotion regulation process. Finally, study four employed positive emotional pictures and here, affect labeling was associated with diminished self-reported pleasure, relative to passive watching. This suggests that affect labeling tends to dampen affective responses in general, rather than specifically alleviating negative affect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

While undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants made social judgments about well-known public ﬁgures. Patterns of brain activity were then predicted using feature encoding models that represented target people’s positions on theoretical dimensions such as warmth and competence. All 5 theories of person perception proved highly accurate at reconstructing activity patterns, indicating that each could describe the informational basis of mentalizing. Cross-validation indicated that the theories robustly generalized across both targets and participants. The synthetic theory consistently attained the best performance—approximately two-thirds of noise ceiling accuracy––indicating that, in combination, the theories considered here can account for much of the neural representation of other people. Moreover, encoding models trained on the present data could reconstruct patterns of activity associated with mental state representations in independent data, suggesting the use of a common neural code to represent others’ traits and states.},

            Individuals often interpret the same event in different ways. How do personality traits modulate brain activity evoked by a complex stimulus? Here we report results from a naturalistic paradigm designed to draw out both neural and behavioral variation along a specific dimension of interest, namely paranoia. Participants listen to a narrative during functional MRI describing an ambiguous social scenario, written such that some individuals would find it highly suspicious, while others less so. Using inter-subject correlation analysis, we identify several brain areas that are differentially synchronized during listening between participants with high and low trait-level paranoia, including theory-of-mind regions. Follow-up analyses indicate that these regions are more active to mentalizing events in high-paranoia individuals. Analyzing participants’ speech as they freely recall the narrative reveals semantic and syntactic features that also scale with paranoia. Results indicate that a personality trait can act as an intrinsic “prime,” yielding different neural and behavioral responses to the same stimulus across individuals.},

            Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) allows estimation of individual-specific cortical parcellations. We have previously developed a multi-session hierarchical Bayesian model (MS-HBM) for estimating high-quality individual-specific network-level parcellations. Here, we extend the model to estimate individual-specific areal-level parcellations. While network-level parcellations comprise spatially distributed networks spanning the cortex, the consensus is that areal-level parcels should be spatially localized, that is, should not span multiple lobes. There is disagreement about whether areal-level parcels should be strictly contiguous or comprise multiple noncontiguous components; therefore, we considered three areal-level MS-HBM variants spanning these range of possibilities. Individual-specific MS-HBM parcellations estimated using 10 min of data generalized better than other approaches using 150 min of data to out-of-sample rs-fMRI and task-fMRI from the same individuals. Resting-state functional connectivity derived from MS-HBM parcellations also achieved the best behavioral prediction performance. Among the three MS-HBM variants, the strictly contiguous MS-HBM exhibited the best resting-state homogeneity and most uniform within-parcel task activation. In terms of behavioral prediction, the gradient-infused MS-HBM was numerically the best, but differences among MS-HBM variants were not statistically significant. Overall, these results suggest that areal-level MS-HBMs can capture behaviorally meaningful individual-specific parcellation features beyond group-level parcellations. Multi-resolution trained models and parcellations are publicly available (https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable\_projects/brain\_parcellation/Kong2022\_ArealMSHBM).},

In this report, we studied the effect of smoothing on MVPA results in a motor paradigm. Subjects pressed four buttons with two different fingers of the two hands in response to auditory commands. Overall, independent of the degree of smoothing, correlational MVPA showed distinctive patterns for the different hands in all studied regions of interest (motor cortex, prefrontal cortex, and auditory cortices). With regard to the effect of smoothing, our findings suggest that results from correlational MVPA show a minor sensitivity to smoothing. Moderate amounts of smoothing (in this case, 1−4 times the voxel size) improved MVPA correlations, from a slight improvement to large improvements depending on the region involved. None of the regions showed signs of a detrimental effect of moderate levels of smoothing. Even higher amounts of smoothing sometimes had a positive effect, most clearly in low-level auditory cortex. We conclude that smoothing seems to have a minor positive effect on MVPA results, thus researchers should be mindful about the choices they make regarding the level of smoothing.},

These regions include the parahippocampal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, anterior temporal poles, and the temporal-parietal junction. Further analyses reveal (1) that these correlated regions can display distinct activation proﬁles and (2) that the results seen with the ISC-SM analysis are complementary to more traditional linear models and allow analysis of complex time course data. Thus, the ISC-SM analysis extends traditional subsequent memory ﬁndings to a rich, dynamic and more ecologically valid situation.},

We explored this question by letting five subjects freely view half an hour of a popular movie while undergoing functional brain imaging. Applying an unbiased analysis in which spatiotemporal activity patterns in one brain were used to “model” activity in another brain, we found a striking level of voxel-by-voxel synchronization between individuals, not only in primary and secondary visual and auditory areas but also in association cortices. The results reveal a surprising tendency of individual brains to “tick collectively” during natural vision. The intersubject synchronization consisted of a widespread cortical activation pattern correlated with emotionally arousing scenes and regionally selective components. The characteristics of these activations were revealed with the use of an open-ended “reverse-correlation” approach, which inverts the conventional analysis by letting the brain signals themselves “pick up” the optimal stimuli for each specialized cortical area.},

These events not only influence momentary physiological and affective responses, but may also have a powerful impact on one’s memory for their emotional experience. In this research, we used the naturalistic context of a haunted house to examine how physiological arousal is associated with metacognitive emotional memory (i.e., the extent to which an individual remembers having experienced a certain emotion). Participants first navigated the haunted house while heart rate and explicit situational appraisals were recorded, and then recalled specific events from the haunted house and the intensity of these affective events approximately one week later. We found that heart rate predicted both the intensity of reported scariness in the haunted house and meta-cognitive memory of affect during recall. Critically, we found evidence for malleability in metacognitive emotional memory based on how the event was initially labeled. Individuals tended to recall events that they explicitly labeled as fear-evoking as being more intense than they reported at the time of the event. We found the opposite relationship for events that they labeled as not fear-evoking. Taken together, this indicates that there are strong relationships between physiological arousal and emotional experiences in naturalistic contexts, but that affective labeling can modulate the relationship between these features when reflecting on the emotionality of that experience in memory.},

Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to  derive multisubject voxelwise similarity measures (inter-subject correlations;  ISCs) of functional MRI data. We used k-nearest-neighbor and support vector  machine classifiers as well as a Mantel test on the ISC matrices to reveal brain  areas wherein ISC predicted the participants' current perspective. ISC was  stronger in several brain regions--most robustly in the parahippocampal gyrus,  posterior parietal cortex and lateral occipital cortex--when the participants  viewed the movie with similar rather than different perspectives. Synchronization  was not explained by differences in visual sampling of the movies, as estimated  by eye gaze. We propose that synchronous brain activity across individuals  adopting similar psychological perspectives could be an important neural  mechanism supporting shared understanding of the environment.},

            The degree to which we are engaged in narratives fluctuates over time. What drives these changes in engagement, and how do they affect what we remember? Behavioral studies showed that people experienced similar fluctuations in engagement during a television show or an audio-narrated story and were more engaged during emotional moments. Functional MRI experiments revealed that changes in a pattern of functional brain connectivity predicted changes in narrative engagement. This predictive brain network not only was related to a validated neuromarker of sustained attention but also predicted what narrative events people recalled after the MRI scan. Overall, this study empirically characterizes engagement as emotion-laden attention and reveals system-level dynamics underlying real-world attention and memory.
          , 
            As we comprehend narratives, our attentional engagement fluctuates over time. Despite theoretical conceptions of narrative engagement as emotion-laden attention, little empirical work has characterized the cognitive and neural processes that comprise subjective engagement in naturalistic contexts or its consequences for memory. Here, we relate fluctuations in narrative engagement to patterns of brain coactivation and test whether neural signatures of engagement predict subsequent memory. In behavioral studies, participants continuously rated how engaged they were as they watched a television episode or listened to a story. Self-reported engagement was synchronized across individuals and driven by the emotional content of the narratives. In functional MRI datasets collected as different individuals watched the same show or listened to the same story, engagement drove neural synchrony, such that default mode network activity was more synchronized across individuals during more engaging moments of the narratives. Furthermore, models based on time-varying functional brain connectivity predicted evolving states of engagement across participants and independent datasets. The functional connections that predicted engagement overlapped with a validated neuromarker of sustained attention and predicted recall of narrative events. Together, our findings characterize the neural signatures of attentional engagement in naturalistic contexts and elucidate relationships among narrative engagement, sustained attention, and event memory.},

	abstract = {Despite the salient experience of encoding emotional events, memories of threatening events are prone to distortions and often non-veridical from encoding to recall. Further, threat states have been shown to preferentially disrupt the binding of item-context relationships and enhance goal-relevant information. While extensive work has characterized distinctive features of emotional memory, research has not fully explored the influence of threat on temporal memory, a process putatively supported by the binding of event features into a temporal context. Two primary competing hypotheses have been proposed; that threat can either impair or enhance temporal memory. We analyzed two datasets to assess temporal memory for an in-person haunted house experience. In study 1 (n= 47), we examined temporal structure of memory by characterizing memory contiguity in free recall as a function of individual levels of physiological arousal as a proxy of threat. In study 2 (n= 53), we replicated marginal findings of threat-related increases in memory contiguity found in study 1 and extended these findings by showing threat-related increases in recency discriminations, an explicit test of temporal order memory. Together, these findings demonstrate that threat experience enhances temporal memory both in terms of free recall structure and during explicit memory judgments.},

	abstract = {Humor is crucial in human social interactions. To study the underlying neural processes, three comedy clips were shown twice to 20 volunteers during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Inter-subject similarities in humor ratings, obtained immediately after fMRI, explained inter-subject correlation of hemodynamic activity in right frontal pole and in a number of other brain regions. General linear model analysis also indicated activity in right frontal pole, as well as in additional cortical areas and subcortically in striatum, explained by humorousness. The association of the right frontal pole with experienced humorousness is a novel finding, which might be related to humor unfolding over longer time scales in the movie clips. Specifically, frontal pole has been shown to exhibit longer temporal receptive windows than, e.g., sensory areas, which might have enabled processing of humor in the clips based on holding information and reinterpreting that in light of new information several (even tens of) seconds later. As another novel finding, medial and lateral prefrontal areas, frontal pole, posterior-inferior temporal areas, posterior parietal areas, posterior cingulate, striatal structures and amygdala showed reduced activity upon re-viewing of the clips, suggesting involvement in processing of humor related to novelty of the comedic events.},

We suggest that building neurophenomenological frameworks holds potential for solving the interrelationships between inner experiences and their neural underpinnings.

Here we show that networks of brain areas “tick together” in participants who are viewing similar emotional events in a movie. Participants’ brain activity was measured with functional MRI while they watched movies depicting unpleasant, neutral, and pleasant emotions. After scanning, participants watched the movies again and continuously rated their experience of pleasantness–unpleasantness (i.e., valence) and of arousal–calmness. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to derive multisubject voxelwise similarity measures [intersubject correlations (ISCs)] of functional MRI data. Valence and arousal time series were used to predict the moment-to-moment ISCs computed using a 17-s moving average. During movie viewing, participants' brain activity was synchronized in lower- and higher-order sensory areas and in corticolimbic emotion circuits. Negative valence was associated with increased ISC in the emotion-processing network (thalamus, ventral striatum, insula) and in the default-mode network (precuneus, temporoparietal junction, medial prefrontal cortex, posterior superior temporal sulcus). High arousal was associated with increased ISC in the somatosensory cortices and visual and dorsal attention networks comprising the visual cortex, bilateral intraparietal sulci, and frontal eye fields. Seed-voxel–based correlation analysis confirmed that these sets of regions constitute dissociable, functional networks. We propose that negative valence synchronizes individuals’ brain areas supporting emotional sensations and understanding of another’s actions, whereas high arousal directs individuals’ attention to similar features of the environment. By enhancing the synchrony of brain activity across individuals, emotions may promote social interaction and facilitate interpersonal understanding.},

Although self-report provides valuable information regarding participants' affective responses, prior studies have raised the concern that the attentional demands of reporting on affective experience may obscure neural activations reflecting more natural affective responses. In the present study, we used potent emotion-eliciting amusing and sad films, employed a novel method of continuous self-reported rating of emotion experience, and compared the impact of rating with passive viewing of amusing and sad films. Subjective rating of ongoing emotional responses did not decrease either self-reported experience of emotion or neural activations relative to passive viewing in any brain regions. Rating, relative to passive viewing, produced increased activity in anterior cingulate, insula, and several other areas associated with introspection of emotion. These results support the use of continuous emotion measures and emotionally engaging films to study the dynamics of emotional responding and suggest that there may be some contexts in which the attention to emotion induced by reporting emotion experience does not disrupt emotional responding either behaviorally or neurally.},

	abstract = {Research on fine-grained dynamic psychological processes has increasingly come to rely on continuous self-report measures. Recent studies have extended continuous self-report methods to simultaneously collecting ratings on two dimensions of an experience. For all the variety of approaches, several limitations are inherent to most of them. First, current methods are primarily suited for bipolar, as opposed to unipolar, constructs. Second, respondents report on two dimensions using one hand, which may produce method driven error, including spurious relationships between the two dimensions. Third, two-dimensional reports have primarily been validated for consistency between reporters, rather than the predictive validity of idiosyncratic responses. In a series of tasks, the study reported here addressed these limitations by comparing a previously used method to a newly developed two-handed method, and by explicitly testing the validity of continuous two-dimensional responses. Results show that our new method is easier to use, faster, more accurate, with reduced method-driven dependence between the two dimensions, and preferred by participants. The validity of two-dimensional responding was also demonstrated in comparison to one-dimensional reporting, and in relation to post hoc ratings. Together, these findings suggest that our two-handed method for two-dimensional continuous ratings is a powerful and reliable tool for future research.},

	abstract = {Thirty married couples were studied during naturalistic interactions to determine the extent to which variation in marital satisfaction could be accounted for by physiological and affective patterns between and within spouses. The authors hypothesized that (a) compared to nondistressed couples' interactions, distressed couples' interactions would show greater physiological interrelatedness or "linkage," more negative affect, and more reciprocity of negative affect and (b) these differences would be more pronounced when the interaction was high in conflict (discussing a marital problem) as opposed to low in conflict (discussing the events of the day). Heart rate, skin conductance, pulse transmission time, and somatic activity from both spouses were analyzed using bivariate time-series techniques to derive a measure of physiological linkage. Self-report affective data (obtained using a video-recall procedure) were analyzed using sequential analyses to derive a measure of affect reciprocity. The hypotheses were strongly supported; 60\% of the variance in marital satisfaction was accounted for using measures of physiological linkage alone. Additional nonredundant variance was accounted for by the other physiological and affective measures. Social interaction provides a rich, naturalistic, and theoretically advantageous context for studying the relations among physiological, affective, and behavioral phenomena. Unfortunately, the demands associated with laboratory experimentation extract significant compromises that may escalate until the experimental context bears little relation to natural dyadic interaction. For example, interaction between two strangers may be substituted for interaction between intimates; a carefully "programmed" confederate may replace the second person; and finally, the confederate may be replaced by a film, a photograph, an audio recording, or a situation created in the subject's own imagery. In this experiment, naturalistic interaction within a husband-wife dyad was used as the context},

	abstract = {Thirty married couples interacted in a low-conflict situation and a high-conflict situation during which continuous physiological measures were obtained. Each spouse returned separately for a second session in which they watched the videotape of the interaction and provided a continuous self-report rating of their own affect while the same physiological measures were again obtained. Observers coded the spouses' affect during each speech unit. The self-reports of affect (a) discriminated the high-conflict interaction from the low-conflict interaction, (b) correlated significantly with marital satisfaction, (c) were coherent between husband and wife, and (d) were significantly related to the observers' coding of the couples' affect. Physiological data obtained during the interaction session were significantly related (using time-series analyses) to physiological data obtained during the recall session. In all comprehensive discussions of emotion the subject's own experience of affect has been considered an important channel of information (see Strongman, 1978). This channel has always been troublesome from an empirical standpoint in terms of meeting psychometric criteria of reliability and validity. One important application of a valid selfreport procedure would be in the study of emotion during social interaction. Ekman, Friesen, and Ellsworth (1972) noted that the study of emotion in the context of social interaction can make a number of unique contributions. One of these contributions is the study of interaction as it unfolds in time, which permits the analysis of the sequential nature of the interaction using time-series analysis. Thus, a method for procuring the self-report of affect that could provide a continuous record over an interaction session would be extremely useful in the study of emotion in social interaction.},

	abstract = {Abstract   In empirical aesthetics, self-reports on subjective experiences are an important source of data. In addition to retrospective ratings, continuous ratings of ongoing experiences or perceptions are particularly promising for examining their dynamic trajectory over time. One crucial question in this regard, however, is whether a continuous rating task affects or even disrupts the aesthetic experience of an art performance. To answer this question, we had 65 participants divided into two groups listen to a recording of the Dadaist sound poem Ursonate by Kurt Schwitters. One group was asked to continuously rate their liking throughout the auditory presentation, whereas the other group listened only. We collected 25 aesthetically evaluative ratings after each of the four movements of the Ursonate and 21 emotion ratings at the very end. Furthermore, throughout the entire presentation of the poem we also continuously measured each participant's heart rate and skin conductance. The two groups did not differ in either kind of retrospective self-report. This lack of differences was corroborated by a lack of differences in physiological responses. Furthermore, the task of giving a continuous liking rating was reported to be reasonably well manageable, although not easy. Thus, asking audiences for continuous ratings does not seem too strenuous a task, and it does not systematically alter the subjective experience as captured in retrospective ratings.},

	abstract = {Humor plays a prominent role in our lives. Thus, understanding the cognitive and neural mechanisms of humor is particularly important. Previous studies that investigated neural substrates of humor used functional MRI and to a lesser extent EEG. In the present study, we conducted intracranial recording in human patients, enabling us to obtain the signal with high temporal precision from within specific brain locations. Our analysis focused on the temporal lobe and the surrounding areas, the temporal lobe was most densely covered in our recording. Thirteen patients watched a fragment of a Charlie Chaplin movie. An independent group of healthy participants rated the same movie fragment, helping us to identify the most funny and the least funny frames of the movie. We compared neural activity occurring during the most funny and least funny frames across frequencies in the range of 1–170 Hz. The most funny compared to least funny parts of the movie were associated with activity modulation in the broadband high-gamma (70−170 Hz; mostly activation) and to a lesser extent gamma band (40−69Hz; activation) and low frequencies (1−12 Hz, delta, theta, alpha bands; mostly deactivation). With regard to regional specificity, we found three types of brain areas: (I) temporal pole, middle and inferior temporal gyrus (both anterior and posterior) in which there was both activation in the high-gamma/gamma bands and deactivation in low frequencies; (II) ventral part of the temporal lobe such as the fusiform gyrus, in which there was mostly deactivation the low frequencies; (III) posterior temporal cortex and its environment, such as the middle occipital and the temporo-parietal junction, in which there was activation in the high-gamma/gamma band. Overall, our results suggest that humor appreciation might be achieved by neural activity across the frequency spectrum.},

	abstract = {Abstract   Naturalistic experimental paradigms in neuroimaging arose from a pressure to test the validity of models we derive from highly-controlled experiments in real-world contexts. In many cases, however, such efforts led to the realization that models developed under particular experimental manipulations failed to capture much variance outside the context of that manipulation. The critique of non-naturalistic experiments is not a recent development; it echoes a persistent and subversive thread in the history of modern psychology. The brain has evolved to guide behavior in a multidimensional world with many interacting variables. The assumption that artificially decoupling and manipulating these variables will lead to a satisfactory understanding of the brain may be untenable. We develop an argument for the primacy of naturalistic paradigms, and point to recent developments in machine learning as an example of the transformative power of relinquishing control. Naturalistic paradigms should not be deployed as an afterthought if we hope to build models of brain and behavior that extend beyond the laboratory into the real world.},

We acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data while participants read a suspenseful literary text (E.T.A. Hoffmann's “The Sandman”) subdivided into short text passages.

Narrative emotions, however, cannot be reduced to a simple associative relationship between emotion words and their experienced counterparts. Intensity in stories may arise without any overt emotion depicting words and vice versa. In this fMRI study we investigated BOLD responses to naturally fluctuating emotions evoked by listening to a story. The emotional intensity profile of the text was found through a rating study. The validity of this profile was supported by heart rate variability (HRV) data showing a significant correspondence across participants between intensity ratings and HRV measurements obtained during fMRI. With this ecologically valid stimulus we found that narrative intensity was accompanied by activation in temporal cortices, medial geniculate nuclei in the thalamus and amygdala, brain regions that are all part of the system for processing conditioned emotional responses to auditory stimuli. These findings suggest that this system also underpins narrative emotions in spite of their complex nature. Traditional language regions and premotor cortices were also activated during intense parts of the story whereas orbitofrontal cortex was found linked to emotion with positive valence, regardless of level of intensity.},

	abstract = {Humans naturally have a sense of humor. Experiencing humor not only encourages social interactions, but also produces positive physiological effects on the human body, such as lowering blood pressure. Recent neuro-imaging studies have shown evidence for distinct mental state changes at work in people experiencing humor. However, the temporal characteristics of these changes remain elusive. In this paper, we objectively measured humor-related mental states from single-trial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data obtained while subjects viewed comedy TV programs. Measured fMRI data were labeled on the basis of the lag before or after the viewer’s perception of humor (humor onset) determined by the viewer-reported humor experiences during the fMRI scans. We trained multiple binary classifiers, or decoders, to distinguish between fMRI data obtained at each lag from ones obtained during a neutral state in which subjects were not experiencing humor. As a result, in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the right temporal area, the decoders showed significant classification accuracies even at two seconds ahead of the humor onsets. Furthermore, given a time series of fMRI data obtained during movie viewing, we found that the decoders with significant performance were also able to predict the upcoming humor events on a volume-by-volume basis. Taking into account the hemodynamic delay, our results suggest that the upcoming humor events are encoded in specific brain areas up to about five seconds before the awareness of experiencing humor. Our results provide evidence that there exists a mental state lasting for a few seconds before actual humor perception, as if a viewer is expecting the future humorous events.},

            Measurement of an individual’s subjective experience of emotion has long been a key component of emotion research, but it presents some unique challenges. Researchers have developed a number of different methods to assess the subjective emotional experiences of study participants, each of which has its strengths and limitations. Self-report measures such as the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, \& Tellegen, 1988) are well established and easy to complete and provide useful information; however, administration of any written measure necessitates an interruption in the flow of an experiment and does not allow frequent or continuous sampling of affective states. More involved methods, such as interviewing, give a detailed and comprehensive picture of a person’s emotions, but they are time-consuming and can provide only a retrospective report of affect. The interactive computer version of the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) Scales (Bradley \& Lang, 1994) allows online assessment of both emotional valence and arousal levels, but it, too, does not provide a continuous record of affect.},

Both hemispheres are equal in average surface area, but hotspots of surface area asymmetry are present in the Sylvian Fissure and elsewhere, together with a broad pattern of asymmetries that are signiﬁcant though small in magnitude. Multiple cortical parcellation schemes registered to the human atlas provide valuable reference data sets for comparisons with other studies. Identiﬁed cortical areas vary in size by more than 2 orders of magnitude. The total number of human neocortical areas is estimated to be {\textasciitilde}150 to 200 areas per hemisphere, which is modestly larger than a recent estimate for the macaque.},

	abstract = {Information processing in the cerebral cortex involves interactions among distributed areas. Anatomical connectivity suggests that certain areas form local hierarchical relations such as within the visual system. Other connectivity patterns, particularly among association areas, suggest the presence of large-scale circuits without clear hierarchical relations. In this study the organization of networks in the human cerebrum was explored using resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using surface-based alignment. A clustering approach was employed to identify and replicate networks of functionally coupled regions across the cerebral cortex. The results revealed local networks confined to sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of association regions. Within the sensory and motor cortices, functional connectivity followed topographic representations across adjacent areas. In association cortex, the connectivity patterns often showed abrupt transitions between network boundaries. Focused analyses were performed to better understand properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal area complex (MT+), lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye field was analyzed to explore how interactions might arise within and between networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of the MT+ complex demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with a hierarchical pathway that spans networks. The functional connectivity of parietal and prefrontal association cortices was next explored. Distinct connectivity profiles of neighboring regions suggest they participate in distributed networks that, while showing evidence for interactions, are embedded within largely parallel, interdigitated circuits. We conclude by discussing the organization of these large-scale cerebral networks in relation to monkey anatomy and their potential evolutionary expansion in humans to support cognition.},

Med. Imag. 17, 463-468) was performed. The  MNI single-subject main sulci were first delineated and further used as landmarks  for the 3D definition of 45 anatomical volumes of interest (AVOI) in each  hemisphere. This procedure was performed using a dedicated software which allowed  a 3D following of the sulci course on the edited brain. Regions of interest were  then drawn manually with the same software every 2 mm on the axial slices of the  high-resolution MNI single subject. The 90 AVOI were reconstructed and assigned a  label. Using this parcellation method, three procedures to perform the automated  anatomical labeling of functional studies are proposed: (1) labeling of an  extremum defined by a set of coordinates, (2) percentage of voxels belonging to  each of the AVOI intersected by a sphere centered by a set of coordinates, and  (3) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by an  activated cluster. An interface with the Statistical Parametric Mapping package  (SPM, J. Ashburner and K. J. Friston, 1999, Hum. Brain Mapp. 7, 254-266) is  provided as a freeware to researchers of the neuroimaging community. We believe  that this tool is an improvement for the macroscopical labeling of activated area  compared to labeling assessed using the Talairach atlas brain in which  deformations are well known. However, this tool does not alleviate the need for  more sophisticated labeling strategies based on anatomical or cytoarchitectonic  probabilistic maps.},

	abstract = {FMRI data acquisition under naturalistic and continuous stimuli (e.g., watching a video or listening to music) has become popular recently due to the fact that it entails less manipulation and more realistic/complex contexts involved in the task, compared to the conventional task-based experimental designs. The synchronization or response similarities among subjects are typically measured through inter-subject correlation (ISC) between any pair of subjects. At the group level, summarizing the collection of ISC values is complicated by their intercorrelations, which necessarily lead to the violation of independence assumed in typical parametric approaches such as Student's t-test. Nonparametric methods, such as bootstrapping and permutation testing, have previously been adopted for testing purposes by resampling the time series of each subject, but the quantitative validity of these speciﬁc approaches in terms of controllability of false positive rate (FPR) has never been explored before. Here we survey the methods of ISC group analysis that have been employed in the literature, and discuss the issues involved in those methods. We then propose less computationally intensive nonparametric methods that can be performed at the group level (for both one- and two-sample analyses), as compared to the popular method of circularly shifting the EPI time series at the individual level. As part of the new approaches, subject-wise (SW) resampling is adopted instead of element-wise (EW) resampling, so that exchangeability and independence assumptions are satisﬁed, and the patterned correlation structure among the ISC values can be more accurately captured. We examine the FPR controllability and power achievement of all the methods through simulations, as well as their performance when applied to a real experimental dataset.},

The importance of this approach is that one can test for differential responses among tasks that may elude more conventional analyses. In particular, we suppose that an evoked response has early and late components and that a differential response may involve (i) both components to the same degree, as in a conventional "activation" or (ii) differential expression of the early and late components in two tasks, as might be seen in differential adaptation, or differences associated with the tasks (e.g., requiring and not requiring sustained attention). Using this approach we were able to demonstrate that the anterior cingulate differentiates, in terms of its response, between two motor tasks that did and did not require sustained attention. This differential response was observed even though there was no classical "activation" (i.e., there was no difference in the mean activity associated with the two conditions). It is suggested that these demonstration results point to the possibility of making greater use of the temporal resolution afforded by fast fMRI techniques.},

	abstract = {Cluster-extent based thresholding is currently the most popular method for multiple comparisons correction of statistical maps in neuroimaging studies, due to its high sensitivity to weak and diffuse signals. However, cluster-extent based thresholding provides low spatial specificity; researchers can only infer that there is signal somewhere within a significant cluster and cannot make inferences about the statistical significance of specific locations within the cluster. This poses a particular problem when one uses a liberal cluster-defining primary threshold (i.e., higher p-values), which often produces large clusters spanning multiple anatomical regions. In such cases, it is impossible to reliably infer which anatomical regions show true effects. From a survey of 814 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies published in 2010 and 2011, we show that the use of liberal primary thresholds (e.g., p {\textless} .01) is endemic, and that the largest determinant of the primary threshold level is the default option in the software used. We illustrate the problems with liberal primary thresholds using an fMRI dataset from our laboratory (N = 33), and present simulations demonstrating the detrimental effects of liberal primary thresholds on false positives, localization, and interpretation of fMRI findings. To avoid these pitfalls, we recommend several analysis and reporting procedures, including 1) setting primary p {\textless} .001 as a default lower limit; 2) using more stringent primary thresholds or voxel-wise correction methods for highly powered studies; and 3) adopting reporting practices that make the level of spatial precision transparent to readers. We also suggest alternative and supplementary analysis methods.},

In some studies, subjects passively perceive evocative stimuli, while in other studies, they perform speciﬁc cognitive tasks. Evidence is emerging that even a simple cognitive task performed on emotionally salient stimuli can affect neural activation in emotion-associated brain regions. We tested the hypothesis that rating the subjective experience of an aversive visual stimulus would decrease limbic/paralimbic activation and increase activity in medial frontal regions. Ten healthy subjects underwent 15O PET scans while they viewed pictures of aversive (AV) and nonaversive (NA) content, taken from the International Affective Picture System. Subjects appraised pictures on a scale of pleasantness/ unpleasantness during one set of scans (RTNG), and they passively viewed pictures during another set (PSVW). After each scan, emotional responses were assessed. RTNG was associated with signiﬁcantly less intensity of sadness and signiﬁcantly less activation (AV Ϫ NA) of the right insula/amygdala and left insula, relative to PSVW. RTNG also activated the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate sulcus, which were not differentially activated during PSVW. For both RTNG and PSVW, subjects activated the left fusiform gyrus. The results support the proposition that task instructions about how subjects should process evocative stimuli can affect neural activity.},

At the most local level, sensory systems (occipital and temporal cortices) maintained a similar temporal activation proﬁle during the two viewings. Nonetheless, functional connectivity between these same lateral temporal regions and other brain regions was stronger during the second viewing. Furthermore, at the level of whole-brain connectivity, we found a signiﬁcant rearrangement of network partition structure: lateral temporal and inferior frontal regions clustered together during the ﬁrst viewing but merged within a fronto-parietal cluster in the second. Our ﬁndings show that repetition maintains local activity proﬁles. However, at the same time, it is associated with multiple network-level connectivity changes on larger scales, with these changes strongly involving regions considered core to language processing.},

In this review, we examine a wealth of recent research on negative emotions in animals and humans, using the example of fear/anxiety, and conclude that, contrary to the traditional dichotomy, both subdivisions make key contributions to emotional processing. Specifically, dorsal-caudal regions of the ACC/mPFC are involved in appraisal and expression of negative emotion, while ventral-rostral portions of the ACC/mPFC have a regulatory role with respect to limbic regions involved in generating emotional responses.

	abstract = {This article describes a new method for assessing the effect of a given film on viewers’ brain activity. Brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during free viewing of films, and inter-subject correlation analysis (ISC) was used to assess similarities in the spatiotemporal responses across viewers’ brains during movie watching. Our results demonstrate that some films can exert considerable control over brain activity and eye movements. However, this was not the case for all types of motion picture sequences, and the level of control over viewers’ brain activity differed as a function of movie content, editing, and directing style. We propose that ISC may be useful to film studies by providing a quantitative neuroscientific assessment of the impact of different styles of filmmaking on viewers’ brains, and a valuable method for the film industry to better assess its products. Finally, we suggest that this method brings together two separate and largely unrelated disciplines, cognitive neuroscience and film studies, and may open the way for a new interdisciplinary field of “neurocinematic” studies.},

These  changes in rs-fcMRI correlations do not arise from, nor are they adequately  countered by, some common functional connectivity processing steps. Two indices  of data quality are proposed, and a simple method to reduce motion-related  effects in rs-fcMRI analyses is demonstrated that should be flexibly  implementable across a variety of software platforms. We demonstrate how  application of this technique impacts our own data, modifying previous  conclusions about brain development.

However, advances in recording and analysis techniques over the last decade have allowed researchers to more directly and precisely examine conversations in natural contexts and at a larger scale than ever before, and these advances open new paths to understand humanity and the social world. Existing reviews of text analysis and conversation research have focused on text generated by a single author (e.g., product reviews, news articles, and public speeches) and thus leave open questions about the unique challenges presented by interactive conversation data (i.e., dialogue). In this article, we suggest approaches to overcome common challenges in the workflow of conversation science, including recording and transcribing conversations, structuring data (to merge turn-level and speaker-level data sets), extracting and aggregating linguistic features, estimating effects, and sharing data. This practical guide is meant to shed light on current best practices and empower more researchers to study conversations more directly?to expand the community of conversation scholars and contribute to a greater cumulative scientific understanding of the social world.},

            Conversation is a primary means of social influence, but its effects on brain activity remain unknown. Previous work on conversation and social influence has emphasized public compliance, largely setting private beliefs aside. Here, we show that consensus-building conversation aligns future brain activity within groups, with alignment persisting through novel experiences participants did not discuss. Participants watched ambiguous movie clips during fMRI scanning, then conversed in groups with the goal of coming to a consensus about each clip’s narrative. After conversation, participants’ brains were scanned while viewing the clips again, along with novel clips from the same movies. Groups that reached consensus showed greater similarity of brain activity after conversation. Participants perceived as having high social status spoke more and signaled disbelief in others, and their groups had unequal turn-taking and lower neural alignment. By contrast, participants with central positions in their real-world social networks encouraged others to speak, facilitating greater group neural alignment. Socially central participants were also more likely to become neurally aligned to others in their groups.},

            How we process ongoing experiences is shaped by our personal history, current needs, and future goals. Consequently, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity involved in processing these subjective appraisals appears to be highly idiosyncratic across individuals. To elucidate the role of the vmPFC in processing our ongoing experiences, we developed a computational framework and analysis pipeline to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of individual vmPFC responses as participants viewed a 45-minute television drama. Through a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging, facial expression tracking, and self-reported emotional experiences across four studies, our data suggest that the vmPFC slowly transitions through a series of discretized states that broadly map onto affective experiences. Although these transitions typically occur at idiosyncratic times across people, participants exhibited a marked increase in state alignment during high affectively valenced events in the show. Our work suggests that the vmPFC ascribes affective meaning to our ongoing experiences.},

Here, we review three lines of work showing that implicit impressions are responsive to information that is highly diagnostic, believable, or reframes earlier experience. These findings complement ongoing research on mechanisms of changing implicit impressions in a wider variety of groups, from real people to robots, and provide support for theoretical frameworks that embrace greater unity in the factors that can impact implicit and explicit social cognition.},

Our data-driven approach allows us to detect event boundaries as shifts between stable patterns of brain activity without relying on stimulus annotations and reveals a nested hierarchy from short events in sensory regions to long events in highorder areas (including angular gyrus and posterior medial cortex), which represent abstract, multimodal situation models. High-order event boundaries are coupled to increases in hippocampal activity, which predict pattern reinstatement during later free recall. These areas also show evidence of anticipatory reinstatement as subjects listen to a familiar narrative. Based on these results, we propose that brain activity is naturally structured into nested events, which form the basis of long-term memory representations.},
