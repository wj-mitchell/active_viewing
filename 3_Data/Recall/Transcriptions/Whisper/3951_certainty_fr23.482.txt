 Alright, so the first the episode starts with Jonathan wife. She goes to Jonathan's lawyer and they just the lawyer asked her where were she during that night of the murder and then she had photos of her walking alone of the night and it's like really dark at night and then so in the room of like Jonathan's wife and the lawyer it's pretty like dimly whipped to and like she's denying that like she had like any part she didn't partake in like the like of what happened and then after that you see Jonathan's wife goes home to she's her father she there's like one maid asking her if she wanted to do something and then they talk I think her father kind of shows this for instance that like he thinks Jonathan did it but it's also he knows that he to everyone knows Jonathan's about Jonathan's affair they also don't like about that and then I think it cuts to the jail scene where you see Jonathan talking to talking to someone I think his lawyer and telling him how he didn't do it he seemed pretty like suspicious but like he said he didn't do it but like I don't know if his mannerisms it seemed like he had something to hide and then the scene after that I think it's when Jonathan's wife's father was hung into Jonathan's wife but great see I think so Grace and her father were talking about I think Gailing and how Grace's father said something like Jonathan and how he didn't think they were a good match with each other before the day and how like she told him her definition of being like a perfect husband and he was just like pung that idea and then Jonathan's father the gracious father went to the went to the jail Jonathan was that talk to him saying how like I think it's like don't heart Grace or something like that and then he fails him out and then I think that's when Jonathan and Grace they walk out and then like all the paparazzi are like taking pictures of them because it's a big news case and they they want to know if they want to know the information from him himself and then he just tells one of these reporters that like he's gonna prove himself innocent all right so after that I think after seeing with Jonathan's son where he was like going up the stairs and then he bumped into I think that victim named Eleanor Eleanor's son and then he said sorry and then Eleanor's son didn't really say anything that but he just said sorry he went to the principal the principal said what do you say to him what was the conversation and then he said hello and then rebel 40 said before I said hello he's he apologized and he said why do you what did you apologize for and then he said he apologized because something with like the four C's and like the C that like he said that he get it for the reason was courtesy they would be courteous but like he's probably apologizing because he he wanted to like I'm sorry for you like mother's out and like even though he's not a ball his father's involved so like it's like an important case and then what happens after the I um I think I'm missing a lot of scenes what the next scene I remember is grace and her father playing chess and her father saying how um well actually I think there's another scene before that I think that was the scene of grace and Jonathan walking in the park and saying uh they're talking about like their relationship and how like uh grace came to leave Jonathan she'd on her but Jonathan saying like he so loved her and then we go back to the fucking chess game with grace and her father and then she's talking about how she admired her parents marriage even though she didn't know that her father she didn't know her mother multiple times and uh that's like a revelation to her because she always thought two parents uh love each other and then even though he said he loved her he still cheated on her multiple times and then he realized that he wasn't healthy so he said he didn't want to live the life anymore so I'm assuming he uh he broke things off with her and then uh he's talking at grace about how she thinks um like her idea of a perfect marriage shouldn't be like based on them and uh grace's father worries that she won't take him back just like her mother gave her father and then she shits his lands the chessboard saying she can't believe how uh weak he thinks she is and then um um I think that's the first episode and then the second episode starts off uh at night at a part with grease and Fernando and Fernando's kind of just like tailing her at a part or like I think she knows that Fernando's looking at her but um I don't know they're just like he's trying to just like observing her and then the what happens um there's a lot of things that I missed I've got in the second episode um but I think the next thing I remember is Jonathan visiting Fernando's apartment with uh Fernando's son uh eating like cereal and ketchup and then um he comes in he uh he kind of like asserts himself and because like Fernando was gonna try to close the door and then put his foot in the like in the door to sell him like he can get into he better he can come in and like say his piece uh at that point I was like uh Jonathan seemed pretty suspicious to me and then uh Fernando uh was like listening to oh no Fernando tells his son to go through his room Jonathan tells Fernando that he wants to make sure that uh he wanted to make sure the kid knew that he didn't do it and then he told Fernando that like oh I wanted to also make sure you knew that I didn't do it but Fernando doesn't believe that um and then Jonathan Fernando make him come to the room with uh what I'm pretty sure is uh Jonathan and Ellen is baby and he says uh do you want do you want to see uh the baby and uh he calls their like oh daddy's here because like like Fernando's not the baby's dad so um and then he started telling Jonathan how like it was pretty hard to love the baby and like he still tried but it's hard to love the baby because it isn't his but um and then Jonathan tells him uh would you like me to keep it and then it cuts to do Jonathan talking to his lawyer uh and his lawyer was like why would you do that that's a terrible idea uh you went to you went to uh like the victims husband like willingly and that would like jeopardize the case um probably making sound more suspicious that he did murder and then they were talking and then she said uh uh you uh I set up uh like a press like um like I said you like on live TV to like kind of speak uh on like speak to the truth and like think like to convince people that uh you didn't do it so they uh they go on live TV uh the live TV it cuts between two scenes of grace oh wait no okay so before that grace gets a phone call oh no wow okay I missed a lot so grace actually fainted towards the middle of the episode of the second episode where did she fainted at the park um yes oh so what happens is like you see the nighttime scene with Fernando and Grace and then Grace passes out at the park and like all these kids are surrounding her and then she goes to the hospital and her father and her sons are already there and then Jonathan like kind of like runs through the hole and gets to her and he's like showing how like he still loves her like he still cares for but um Grace's father still loves Adam like like it's authentic like he doesn't believe that he loves her but um so that happens so I brought that up because that leads to Grace getting a phone call from one of her friends saying oh what happened to uh what happened to you um and then she said oh it was fresh I got dish charge and then that allowed her to she's like oh you should um you should visit the pond so like Grace visits her friends place and then that brings us to like the end of the episode where like she's at her friends place uh I think with her kid I'm not too sure but she she's at her friends she's watching the news where Jonathan is telling what he what happened in like the murder and then he's saying to the news reporter like oh I didn't do it uh I came here to clear the mood of clear the air and then he um he said I didn't do it and then she's like all right then do you have an idea that you love you dead and then he looks in the camera and then the camera on the the friends place vicious friends place he zooms into Grace's face and to like to making believe like the audience like oh maybe it was her you get it so like Jonathan had the news reporter uh at the news uh the news place he looks into the camera and he like it looks like he's like looking like at her and then he's like yeah I do not really get it and then episode ends uh I'm done
