 Nk ... ...iph um and she kind of got frustrated with his responses and just asked for his unconditional support at the moment or like love um so oh pay all money that's how we got here um the lawyer that's why we see the guy in jail before we meet the father so yeah so crossing the street then lawyers office then jail we meet the accused and then the accused meets the lawyer and they discuss bail options um and he discusses how he uses strange from his entire family and she thinks that's a little suspicious um and then we see the wife and her father at dinner with the maid and then the maid leaves once they continue the conversation and she asks for his oh at some point um I don't think she asked for the money at this point I think this is where she just talks about like emotional and the term like unconditional support comes and because that's used later but eventually they talk about the bail and he goes to visit the guy in jail and the guy starts off by saying like he wants the father and all to understand and then the father and all the time I don't care about your understanding you need to understand me um that my daughter may love you and like I'm doing this for her but basically he doesn't trust the guy and then when the guy just begins he just kind of leaves and he's like I'm done here and gets up um these are a matter of fact and um yeah so then he leaves the jail and then what's the next scene? the next scene might be when the kid is running and he pumps the kid of the accused and then he's like saying like sorry sorry he's like running and we don't know what he's running towards but we know he's running in the courtyard um of his school and before going up the steps he pumps into the accused the victim's son and then he says sorry and then he also just says hi and like sat his hand and then we see him in the principal's office and the principal is kind of grilling him about like what happened and he's like oh like i bumped into him and i said sorry and then the principal grills him out like why he says sorry and i guess the kid catches on right because he could in mean like oh i'm sorry about your mom or like i'm sorry that i bumped into you um so he recites the five sees which i assume have to do with the school's mantra or something um and then the schoolmaster or like the principal or whatever they're called is like please with his answer in relating to like the five sees and saying that he said sorry out of courtesy um because he prompted no but he doesn't mention to the principal that he like reached out to shake his hand um so seems like there's some understanding there on the kids part and the principal's part um oh uh there was some point where um the father and law bumps into the friend of i think the wife's name is graysome's gonna call her grays the redhead Nicole Kidman she bumps into her at the playground with her daughter and then um she's ends like her daughter off because i guess they're late or something and she talks to the father and she just like says she's like reached out to grays before and if grays needs anything to like let her know or what not and the father kind of like has understanding and they're sitting in the courtyard at the same school um but there's also a scene i don't know if this comes before after this when huger has been released from prison and he's like walking through the crowd and we see him with the lawyer and his wife and they're kind of like kind of like forced away i guess out of the prison or wherever they are and um they were surrounded by press and he kind of stops them and says like um just to say he says that he is looking forward to clearing his name or something of that type of thing but nothing incriminating um nothing gambling um what else then there's a scene where uh well he's out of prison now and there's a scene where the two of them are walking along the river and um i guess he's under the assumption that like they're going to stick through this and work through this together and she she clarifies like oh no like i'm not we're not doing this also this is like daytime mostly scenes have been taken place in the daytime we only seen thus far has been taken place like the night time is the first shot of her um with the photos the crosswalk i don't know if that's important but some deep go then then the cold khenman kind of gets them in their walk and like the cold khenman kind of gets like emotional and like we know we're not in this together and the new khen also gets emotional and um i believe he like he maybe tries to do some apology but then he also hugs her and it's kind of like a force cut of like she's in the middle of saying something like we're separate or like we're not in this together and he's like yay i know i know but like we're still together and like kind of like hugs her and then um she seems to be lucky to the hug but like does it and then like she breaks free from it um and they continue like walking um then i don't know where the first flip ends and the next one begins but throughout the other clip um we see Hugh Grant go visit the the fall oh i guess this is the first flip well at some point Hugh Grant goes visit the father of or the the husband other victim who's like the father of the kid that his kid bumped into we also see a scene at some point i don't know where the scene is but almost like we're meeting the victim for the first time or maybe Hugh Grant was meeting the victim for the first time like across a crowded room and it was like it was daytime maybe daytime or like sunrise or sunset like the sun's in prominent or like we like we just be like lighting like highlighting the victim but basically she was like center stage um yeah center that's the first time but then we have the second flip beginning with grace i believe Nicole can been walking through some wooded area and then she comes across a field of like children playing and we also see like the the victim's husband in the background but that's just like a dark scene like a physically dark scene um so i don't know if they are if it's like a memory or if it's like two things happening in sync or one not but those two things are occurring and then we see Nicole can be like approach these kids and it's daytime and she makes like eye contact or like she focuses on a child that i guess is supposed to resemble her where she's like young with like long red hair and whatnot and i think they're playing like soccer or something but like they're on the big field like touch on her running around and like she notices this one girl and then she has like a panic attack and then she's in the hospital um she has a little like she fainted and then like she says later that's a panic and when we like skip to the scene in the hospital so she's in the bed her son is on her right side and then her father is sitting down like in the chair behind the sun um and she kind of wakes up and then he grand like first in the room and like you can see everyone's shock um you can tell that the father like the lady's father is like maybe like annoyed or like frustrated that he's there like i don't know the entrance is kind of over the top he really like busted in there and like you see the sun like a little hopeful but has a change like maybe happy to see his father um but it doesn't really like converse with him too much um the father like checks in on the wife and like you know he's a doctor so he does his medical stuff and like checks her eyes and has her follow checks her people dilation um right eye then left eye I believe versus like that then uh like maybe like squeezes finger but then they do thing where like touch a finger a touch a nose they do that two times and she seems to have already done this before because she was like shows the surprise with the touch finger touch nose they need prompting um but then like once like he like does like his little evaluation he like takes a cacire relief and like grabs her hand and i think the sun sees this and it kind of gives him a little bit of hope um yeah so then i don't know if like this is when he goes to visit the other kid or like the other um family like the victim's family the husband and like we're in like a a darker apartment or like stairwell and then like goes in it's definitely like a smaller apartment than um you would expect or like you would you think like Hugh Grant lives in um so like you knock on the door guy opens up and then guy on like the tries to close the door and then Hugh Grant just put in the door keeps it open and um like can i come in and basically the guys like no you can't come in and then they have like some kind of discourse and i basically Hugh Grant just like let me in so he does which is interesting because if you really believe that this man read or your wife and now you're gonna bring him into your home with your family that's interesting um so they go and the sun's in the kitchen and the man's in the kitchen and then Hugh Grant enters the kitchen into dark light room like i think like the kitchen is like the first it's the first thing as soon as you open the door maybe like a round table in the middle um some lighting from like like i don't know like back lighting um and it could stay there for a while without being prompted to leave um but eventually Hugh Grant was like after like the the guy eventually did prompt the kid to leave Hugh Grant was like no no no like he needs to stay in the kitchen he's here he's like i didn't kill her um just like professing his innocence and whatnot which is very bold move um but it's also even bolder to let like the accused into your home with your children that's fine and then we hear baby crying so um eventually like they all go in and see the baby and uh what's the the victim's husband um back up with the baby from our principal bottle from the bottle warmer feeds the baby and then like ask Hugh Grant like if he wants to hold there or he's held it before and Hugh Grant i was like yes i've held it before um and then the the the husband is like oh i'm trying so hard to love her oh yeah actually says like here's your baby so like he clearly knows i don't know how long he's known for but yes um and he's like i tried to love her but it's fine like very difficult but i'll continue trying and i don't know if there's like it seems like they're might i don't know they like may have talked about i don't think they talked about Hugh Grant taking the baby but they did discuss like how the baby is his and how the husband has like difficulty loving the baby and then like we flip to um um Hugh Grant in the lawyers office and the lawyers like yelling at him like oh like why would you do that and then the lawyer like talks about um oh before like they're like oh like why did you do that like that's witness tampering and then Hugh Grant was like no no like i didn't do anything i didn't tell any i didn't threaten him or anything but the lawyers like it doesn't matter like and he's like oh i know why you did this because you feel like you're charming and like you're cocky so you think that you can get away with anything um and then so essentially like she comes up with this idea she's like we need to see we need the jury to see you just as like you see you just as cocky as you see you um so she essentially like tries to seduce him where it's it's essentially a test um where she's like as she's speaking to him she's like getting closer and like telling him how charming he can be and whatnot and i guess she's like waiting to see if he engages in this and he doesn't but right like he's a charming doctor like he's not like well like he knows things so i we thought when you like this was a test um yeah so and then he asks like that i pass and she says barely what rent oh and it might have been in their first encounter what they talk about their previous previous affairs he has another affair one that he's devastated over and this preceded the current victim so don't know what happened to the first lover but yeah he had one i think it was discussed in the first meeting but this meeting just made it come to my mind um then they talk about like okay like you care's magic and he's like oh you barely passed the test like we're gonna get you out in front of the public um and she's like we're gonna book you on the late show or like a uh i don't know talk show and this is like taking place in her office now and like her office is like the same as before so it's kind of big she has like her desk and then like it's like on the if you're looking at the screens on the right hand side like her desk and then like they move over to the left where like he is and that's where like the whole like deduction test takes place um so they move around the room quite a lot and then after that they start talking about like um their next strategy um there was a point also i don't know where it was but uh the friend that i had mentioned she reaches out to the wife and is like hey like do you want to hang out we can just have like a girl's night you can drink wine and um whatnot and i think the girl declined but just remember that scene um and then we flipped to the show maybe like the talk show i'm trying to think if there's anything in between that with the kid okay so then we're on the talk show and it's just him his lawyer and what's it called and the interviewer and the interviewer showed up asking like oh are you innocent and he answers um answers yes which is like interesting for a court show right or for a court proceeding because you usually don't give the finitives yes we know so i think that like leans towards certain key that he's kind of innocent because now like he can be questioned about that it can move around on the stand like a severe innocent like what not anyway um and then like his affect changes a bit throughout the thing he seems to get like frustrated as the questions go on and then the talk show and you see like the lawyer trying to like calm him down and the talk show host is like oh like you seem like you're a victim and he's like no i'm not the victim in the traditional sense but i am a victim in the case that like i did lose somebody that i love oh and like as this is going on we flip between the wife is watching it at home potentially with her father not the kid i don't think so but potentially with her father and then he was like yeah like i lost somebody that i love and then you see like shot come over her face because um probably like the word love like shocker she realized they were actually in love um
