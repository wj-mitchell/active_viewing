 Okay, so we started like the episode with seeing the wife walk around. She's like walking through the streets of New York City. You don't really give an idea of what, but it looks like it's a flashback and then you're in the lawyer's office and the lawyer's asking her like why the heck was she walking so close to where the girl was murdered. And she didn't have a great explanation other than she likes to do nightly work. She walks, which I guess makes sense, you know, if you're a bit of a stressed out person, you're walking around. And the lawyer was like well lucky for you, we have way more evidence for your husband than they do on you. So like they're not really focused on you anyways. But still you walk around near the murder that weird. And like you're kind of left on that but they don't really touch on it there. They just kind of leave it at that. And then she starts talking to her about like is there anything else you're hiding from me? And she's like no of course not like why would I have something to hide. And this is when you're kind of first introduced that she comes from a really privileged family because the lawyer starts getting like a long dietribe about how like privileged people hide stuff and they want to keep their status. And basically just the whole rich privilege of rent. And you're like okay so she's rich and this lawyer's probably a high profile lawyer. And she like assures the lawyer that she doesn't know anything but she wants to know why the lawyer's kind of like breeding her so much I guess breeding is a strong word. But basically why she's asking so many questions and lawyers like oh well the trial kind of hinges on how you do maybe. Like there's a chance that like it hinges on how you do. Oh and one of the questions she was like she was really going in on was like the girl who died. She was wanting to know why she thought the husband was kind of violent or like a little unhinged. And the girl's like I don't know I just kind of got a vibe. I kind of got this vibe that he's a bit angry. But like she couldn't really pin down something specific so the lawyer like kind of like will you're a clinical psychologist? I think that's what she said. A clinical psychologist. So like give me your analysis of the situation. And she basically was like I don't know he just kind of seemed aggressive and that's where the conversation of like why are you asking so many questions came up. And lawyers like oh we need you to testify and the wife was like like heck no I'm not testifying like you're not getting me on that stand like we cut out of that seat. And then we see the girl I think she's like named fletcher in this lecture but I don't remember her first thing. But we see her like go home to like her obviously like super wealthy family like we got made so we got like long ridiculous dining tables and her dad's just sitting there with his like really fluffy eyebrows and like just looking like a rich man. And she's like I need some support. I don't like this lawyer and you're kind of like closed off and I just want to feel supported and that was like kind of like okay but this whole conversation gets interrupted by the police showing up. And it's very clear that the girl is like done with the police thing at her life because she is not happy to see it. And they just kind of have like that typical like New York cop stereotype vibe anyways of like a we're bad guys and we've got bad guy questions asked. And they're like we found out that you've gotten a lot of phone calls from Eleanor which is the girl we got. We got a lot of phone calls from Eleanor and you didn't like how well did you know her and this slush was like uh not at all. I never talked to her day in my life which seems believable because the cops back it up by saying like yeah you never answered it but she's like super defensive and like angry. I don't know if she's angry just tired of the cops or if she's like angry about this line of questioning because you can kind of hear it in her voice when she's like I always assume it's a spam call like it's very like aggressive compared to how she was talking to the lawyer previously. But basically like she said she never answered the cops like okay yeah I guess but why is there this painting of you in the Eleanor's studio or in her basement and the girl looks pretty freaked out but like you can't really tell if she's freaked out because she has been found out or if like she didn't even know this was going on. But we cut to another scene uh her and her husband are now walking along the border wall, a border wall somewhere like near a river and um they're like discussing why in the world this painting exists because her husband was sleeping with her presumably she knows why Eleanor has a painting ever and the husband's like not uh I knew she was a bit crazy I knew she was a bit obsessed with you but I don't know why she had that painting like that's a bit weird um and that's kind of the old explanation we get because beyond that them to just start arguing about like their marriage and how they'll make it through together and um he's all like gas lighty and like I love you we can never be taken apart and she's like you know dude not only are you accused for murder but you definitely cheated on me like why are we even having this discussion and then he does one of those like oh just hold me and she's like not having it she's like I'm a strong impediment woman who does not need to have this conversation with you and then they kind of like ended there but then they keep walking uh I don't know why she's still walking with the machiso pissed off but I guess it is what it is um and then we cut to oh I think we go to a scene where like she's talking to her dad and she's like oh wait I missed some stuff I missed when he was like still in jail oh okay wait so um there's a scene where like the lawyer is talking to uh Mr. Pletcher in jail and we find out that he definitely had another girl that he had been unfaithful with prior to Elador who has been murdered but only one um the lawyer kind of gives him the same rundown of like hey you'd be honest with me uh tell me the truth all that and he kind of just brushes it off and does his thing and then we cut to the scene where like um the girl was talking to her dad and she's like I need two billion dollars to get him out of jail um and his family couldn't put up any money for the two million dollars we find out during the prison scene because he's estranged from his family for some reason and it's in play they're pretty poor so it gives like a very like Gatsby-esque experience of like he comes from nothing and he probably lied his way to like the top right at like upper echelons of society like that's kind of the vibe you get um but anyways miss ma'am is like talking to her dad and she's like he had the two billion dollars daddy please and he's like in the middle of an art museum which is a very weird place at this conversation um but he does but not before going to the prison himself looking Mr. Pletcher down the eyes and being like I think he killed her I'ma let you out because I love my daughter but I think you killed her and if you do something to hurt my daughter or anyone like I'ma kill you um which fair enough um but he does pay the two million dollars he gets out of jail um we have like the whole journalism scene which kind of lets us know that this case is a very high profile because like they can't even have walked or being pool swarms by reporters um and then boardwalk all that stuff I already talked about um so and then like she also tells her dad about um her son being like at risk at school and we see a scene where like he accidentally bumps into the boy who is the son of the girl who is married Eleanor um and the son of the Pletcher's I swear I hope I'm gonna make it um but the son of the Pletcher's um and the son of Eleanor both go to the same school Pletcher's son accidentally bumped into Eleanor's son and there's like a whole scene of like oh my goodness I'm so sorry I didn't mean to bump into you but um I don't know why Eleanor's son can't talk but he doesn't say a word he just like stairs blankly out at the son and then there's a scene where the head mister I'm assuming it's a head mister is like why were you talking to him why did you bump into him and so we kind of give some foreshadowing there but Eleanor is telling her dad like hey they want to kick my son out of school presumably because it's awkward as heck for the child of a dude who murdered said murder victim like I'm sure that's just awkward school politics so that's probably a part of it and like assuming it's a richy rich school like it's coming off to be they don't want the publicity around it's kind of the implication that's being hacked but the dad also goes to the school and that's where we're introduced to Eleanor's blonde hair friend we're not giving a lot of details about her but it's clear that she really cares about Eleanor and has a daughter around a similar age so like they probably've been friends for a bit um and then that friend um is like kind of a support system throughout the episode so that's what we're introduced to her and that whole like kind of conflict with the school and then we see Eleanor walking at night and I'm not Eleanor miss Lutcher's walking at night through the park and for some reason Eleanor's husband is like creeps stir following her um it's not really ever explained why he's just like vibing behind some trees doing some detective like nonsense like staring at her while she walks through the forest and she kind of senses this but we don't ever see that she sees it we just kind of get the vibe that she senses she's being watched and then food cut we're somehow in the daytime she's still walking I don't know if this is all the same vlog or these are separate instances but she's still walking and then it starts to snow and like there's a like a group of kids and she has like a weird fantasy zone out moment the snow's going backwards the world's moving slow and then boom she just like knocks out um which is a lot but we cut to her like her in the hospital her son and her dad has like rushed to see her she seems fine the sun's obviously worried for his mother and like of course his dad was just in jail and that was mom's like passing out all over New York City um and then her dad is like you know fair vibing and then the husband like comes bustin in running half an pump and like oh let me check you out when you do an ice fan let me make sure you're okay so I guess I were supposed to kind of get the idea that like he really cares about her from the scene but he's there he's supportive he's holding her hand and the dad looks past the dad is like I don't like none of this but the sun it's like clear that he's hopeful his parents are going to get back together because he looks very happy about it um and then oh what's after that oh then the like the friend the blonde friend I was talking about earlier she like calls and she's like oh my god you just passed out in New York City are you okay and elders like or not oh and the flutcher girl is like kind of brush like it off she's like I'm fine I'm good you know it's totally normal I'm just a bit stressed um but they both agreed that they're gonna have a boozy drinking night together later to kind of like decompress and de-stress whatever um I'm not missing anything I think we're on the right track um next thing you know flutcher murder dude hope like is bustin through the door of the husband of the girl he presumably murdered um and he's like boom shoving his foot in like let me in and this is the second time we've seen this dude cross some consent boundaries so that's a bit sketch but whatever um he basically like all but forces himself into the hope of the dude who's why he cheated on and then maybe murder for some reason and then he starts like touching up on the boy because he used to be his doctor he's like you look good I didn't do this I'm like why would the sun care he used to sound like you're vibing trying to do his homework in his like place um but a really interesting thing about this scene is we see the Eleanor really was like not well off and probably living in like poverty but like in the weird TV way in which like you can somehow own a really big studio apartment in New York City and before you know what I mean what's that kind of poverty um and uh he like starts talking to the husband and he's like I didn't do this you know I didn't do this you know something wasn't right with Eleanor and like we need to get to the bottom of it and the husband rightfully so is like my dude uh he slept in my wife like why would I want to help you like I don't care um and the fletch was like well whatever stay away from my wife so the dude's like uh that's kind of like the pot calling the kettle black hello the phone is ringing come inside the house could you not say that to me but this isn't really a dress because a baby starts crying and I'm gonna like whose baby is this um but they walk back there and it's definitely his baby uh mr. fletcher not the husband because that baby young that baby like newborn um and then he like confirms this because he's like do you want to feed your daughter and he's like daddy's home which is mad awkward like big awkward because his son is like right there his son is like right right there and I don't know if that's the conversation we need to be having in front of your son but what ever and they have like a whole no-mit where he's like have you met her before um have you fed her before uh and mr. fletcher's like yeah yeah I have like no shame let's do this even like pretend the lives of this dude but whatever um and then the dad's like the dad and the husband of Eleanor is like um it's hard for me to love her which yeah fair enough um and then fletcher basically um offers to take the daughter which like what are you gonna do take the baby to chill with you dude but whatever um and then we cut to fletcher in the law office with his attorney and she's like uh my dude you just broke like so many rules and broke the like rules of your bail by going to see that guy um because that's called witness tampering and he was like I didn't think it was that big of a deal which again shows us this dude has no concept of boundaries or any respect for boundaries because he's like laws for weeks but um but the lawyer is like uh oh so you're one of these kind of guys you're charming and your handsome you've kind of always gotten by by like talking your way out of situations so again we're getting kind of alluded to that this guy's kind of kind of privileged wife um through his looks and maybe his ability to manipulate people but not the same kind of privilege as his wife where it like comes from money because like that's not really brought up it's just his looks and his like charisma um and then she was like you thought you could change this guy's mind you think through that charismatic that you can um changes mine and then they have like a weird sexual tension moment but like isn't really explain but like she's like oh I don't know it was weird it was sexual tensiony and then what you're kind of like robust it is like nah I'm good then and she was like yeah it was a test you passed the test it it was strange I didn't really get the point of it but whatever they basically come to an agreement that he needs to go on national television because like kind of like the Johnny Depp Amber heard case like is whole cases being like in the media and it's occurring in the media so if they don't uh also present their case um after he's kind of been lambasted by the media that the federal may be changed the jury pool or cut the way the jury looks at them and if he can go on the media kind of show his side of the story about being cross-sensed and then he can kind of get ahead of this so they do um you see him on the news in the script news program it's not very specific um and he's like talking about how uh he definitely didn't kill her um he loved her how does this even begin I'm trying to remember how this like whole newscasts it but the gist is it's like he starts doing some sob story nonsense where he's like crying and talking about how much he loved her which is kind of weird because this whole time he's been implying how much he loves his wife and wants to go back to his wife but now he's like crying on national television like I loved Eleanor and I lost her too and I felt like I was the cause of her death because us sleeping together is probably what caused um whoever to murder her to murder her so I don't know if he's like implying his wife did it or the husband but he's definitely implying one of those two did it um and he was saying like the police aren't doing their full job because um you know they're blaming it on me and a lawyer saying like it's an election year they want to like get this off quickly no matter who it hurts um and they're both basically backing up his side and the whole time it's like cutting to his wife the blonde friend the dad and the son like in a room watching this and like he don't care who's getting hurt by what he's saying he doesn't care that his wife and his son are definitely watching this or is that's why are definitely watching this he's just like yeah I loved her um and I'm so hurt that I love this so you can kind of see he has a disregard for their feelings for the sake of his own innocence um and then like the whole episode ends with um him basically being asked does he know or does he think he knows who killed her and he's like I do okay I'm done I spayed as probably a fit log hey
