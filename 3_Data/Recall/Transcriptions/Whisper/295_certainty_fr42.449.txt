 So from what I remember, I remember the scene starting with the wife and the attorney talking and it seemed like the attorney was accusing the wife because the wife was out and she was out on the street or something when the woman was murdered. So it made it seem like the attorney was accusing the wife of the murder and from there I remember a lot of the wife and her father talking a lot. So I think that's why I assumed more that it was either the mother or the grandfather who murdered the woman. So they had a lot of talk going back and forth and I remember seeing Jonathan and Jail and then he was let go and I can't remember much more about the first part of the session. But then in the second part of the session I felt like I got to see more about Jonathan and more of his innocence. So the reason why I was thinking that he was innocent because I know that he was a cheater or 100% but he was unwilling to say that he murdered her. So I thought that I just believe that people tell the truth most of the time but also I just kept on going back to how the grandfather and the mother were having conversations about different items and how the grandfather even said that he was a cheater and so it made him seem like he hasn't done the greatest things in his past and would do anything for his daughter's happiness. And then the attorney was mad at Jonathan but because Jonathan went to see the man who was married to his lover so the husband and when he did at first I thought like I felt Jonathan was becoming more guilty because he went to go see him in person and the conversation seemed tense because the father was upset of course because he's accused Jonathan as accused of his wife's murder but later to come up to find out that he was the father of the newborn baby and the other father was talking about how he is so hard to feel that he can care for this baby because it's Jonathan's child so that was really tense but another thing was when Jonathan first came to the house the son was there and the son was he seemed on edge too because Jonathan was there because I'm assuming that the child knows that Jonathan is accused of the murder but Jonathan walked up to him and touched his face to check in with him because that son does have cancer and he was his patient so I do feel like I'm missing the whole other part of the story where about the two sons where there was a scene from the first part with the two sons and how they go to school together and how the Jonathan son bumped into the other boy the woman's murder who was murdered child and he was the other boy didn't say anything but Jonathan said pumped into him and said sorry and then they had to go the principal's office and they talked about how Jonathan's son was going to be suspended because of the news and how it just wouldn't be right for his son to be in school the same school of his is of the woman's son was murdered and then towards the end of the movie what happened towards the end of the movie I believe that Jonathan was innocent and it was left on a cliff hanger because Jonathan said that he wanted to go on the news and share his story and so that people would believe him and so in the news when he was on the news with his attorney on his lawyer he talked about his innocence and people were just like aren't you just well the interviewer was like are you just doing this so you're more you you seem more like a victim and he was basically like no because I feel like I know who there's more of a motive from other people and I feel like I know who those people may be so it was left on a cliff hanger of um he knows who the murder is but he does not want it he's not sure who it is so Billy should I still keep going I'm sorry I'm literally horrible so storyteller so thanks you
