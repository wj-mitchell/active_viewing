 So, the scene, it opened up the wife was talking to Jonathan's lawyer, her brilliant name was great. The wife's name was great, so she's talking to Jonathan's lawyer and they're discussing about his case and she kind of seemed like she was guilty of something that I wasn't sure it was. And then the next scene, it went on. I believe it was Grace with her father. They were accused of describing Jonathan and had not entrusted him, and he wasn't good for her. And Grace just wanted her father to be by her side and had her conditional support. And then the father seemed a little off to, I wasn't sure what it was, but it was also like he was tired and something. And then, if we're not, I believe the Grace's father went to go meet Jonathan and the lawyer went to meet Jonathan and jail and Jonathan seemed a little innocent. He wasn't really too nervous about his case. He seemed like he was ready to accept whatever happened or he was ready to get out or I don't know, he just seemed very calm in the situation compared to how I would think. I think it should be the lawyer in a sense for me to get into it. And then I remember the father going to Jonathan and the jail and the father was the accused of doing it, saying he wasn't innocent. And he didn't really trust Jonathan later on in the scene he talks about. He doesn't really like Jonathan. And Jonathan, then I only seen Avery, who just adopted that. And the next thing I remember was the son bumping into the victim son and he apologized for bumping into him and the son seemed to be very nice. And the victim son also seemed to be OK. And then the son was talking to someone and they were kind of, I don't remember who it was, but they weren't really happy that the son said sorry to the victim son and that was pretty odd. The son, the autism genuinely because he talked about how he's trying to do good. And then I remember Jonathan going to, I remember Jonathan and Grace going on for a walk and they were talking and Grace, she thinks he doesn't even kill her, but she's also feel very betrayed and heard by what Jonathan's disability and she just seems a little confused about what she should do after. And then I remember Grace talking to her father, telling her father, the father telling her not to believe Jonathan was going to the strap and then she Grace talked about how she wanted her family and he happy and how she always saw her parents and then her father told her that she did on his wife and she was very angry about that. She didn't want to believe it. She thought it wasn't true and the father had to tell her that she had to accept it and that it happened and all those gifts were just because he cheated and that he loved his wife and she was angry and then threw the chest and she meant it and she said something about how she could even die and the father about Jonathan, about believing in Jonathan. And then, like soon, Jonathan goes over to the victim's family house and she sees the son well he sees the son and he apologizes and sometimes that his mother passed away but since he didn't do it and then the victim's husband, he didn't want to let him in at first. He actually had to think about the door but Jonathan kept pushing himself in and he finally let Jonathan in and then the baby monitor went off after Jonathan said he didn't kill her and Jonathan was going to picture of the victim on the wall and then the victim's husband went to go pick up the baby and it kind of birded like maybe the baby wasn't his or her because he was saying now he didn't really love the baby in the way and was asking Jonathan if he had seen the baby and if he was a year of kids in the baby and if he had helped the baby and basically I've seen questions about how close he was to the baby and then the victim's husband was very distraught in a way maybe because he's a potential child and yeah I remember the son he was listening but they didn't want to make it seem like he was listening and it's bad. He told him to go in his room pushing him in the air in the beginning so he was actually listening and then the next thing I remember was the lawyer and Jonathan had another meeting and kind of birded that they kind of had a relationship maybe in the past she was saying how she wanted she wanted people to see Jonathan the way she sees him in the way how other people see him and yeah she kind of she was angry that he went and she was saying how he really thinks that he was going to change the husband's mind I don't know how to describe it basically saying like does he think he has that kind of power in the son and he didn't really think he was doing that but she was asking the woman to do that and then she mentioned about why I'm like to be and describing what happened well just proving his innocence and then he agreed to it and she said she should be by his side and then next thing Grace went for a walk I think this happened before that sleep but Grace went for a walk and she woke up in the middle of the night randomly and she went for a walk and the victim's husband was following her but she didn't know she realized and she was walking until the sun came up and then she ended up at her and she saw her explain and then she kind of felt lightheaded in the sense that she was looking at us still and she saw a girl who kind of resembled her and assuming what I thought it kind of looked like her and it was like the younger version of her in a way she was looking at her and then she got just lightheaded and you can tell she's about to pass out and she passed out I thought she might have been a cheap person and then she was at the hospital the grandfather and the son of a ride and then Jonathan ran in the hospital he was looking like his very very lucky one and then he came to his wife and he held her head and he really wanted to check on her and make sure she was okay and she basically said she was fine and she didn't need any help but he took her hand and then moved his hand like the flashlight, checked her eyes to check her pupils like us and then he used his index finger and touched her nose and then touched him and like swam her and then moved that back and forth and then that was it a little before in that scene I remember the grandfather was talking to I guess it's her best friend or his sister I don't know but he was talking to this other lady that was supposed to graze and she was out of that lady's video basically asking the father how she is and Grace said that and the grandfather said that Grace was fine, well she pretends to be fine and she's her and then yeah and then but after the hospital I remember the best friend they were on the phone and they were talking and she asked Grace wanted to come over to not be stressed just to stress really they could drink and she basically she thought Grace was under a lot of stress so the Grace doesn't want to say that she got under a lot of stress so she's just sitting there and then after the hospital scene I remember I remember them being on my television and Jonathan's stand with the lawyer and the reporter and Jonathan talks about how he apologizes when my television is white and it's sun purified and then the reporter asks questions basically saying that she's sorry for hurting his wife but he did not, he did but he said that he didn't kill the victim and then Jonathan said he didn't kill her and then but the reporter said that his DNA is all about apartment and then the lawyer stepped in to talk because she saw Jonathan was getting frustrated and she said that the police also knew they probably made a human mistake trying to prove his innocence and then Jonathan he was just sitting there and little and distraught little lost and then he mentions how the reporter asked him later on if he was a victim but he said he's not a victim but the law seems to get that he also loved this woman even though he cheated on his wife he didn't love the victim and he didn't murder her and then he talked, he basically signulates that somebody was jealous and it could have been someone who murdered, someone who knew murdered the victim and then it went to the wife's family, they were all sitting there and they were watching the news and she looked at her, go to your little upset, but yeah and also in the beginning the police they knocked on her door, asked to say that the victim called her several times before she died and then showed a picture, he said that the victim was a painter and then she basically painted she painted Grace and Grace kind of like closed it on their face and it was saying much about it after they showed her the picture of the painting and then oh yeah in the scene like later on in that scene, Jonathan also kind of said she was a stalker I guess for doing that, she said she knocked on her door when they were walking outside but going back to being on live television so the wife should be a little distraught and then it went to the victim's husband and she seemed, I mean he seemed, he was wanting to be a baby he seemed a little upset because Jonathan was saying he was the scene waiting that he needed a murderer and his scene upset and then Jonathan said he knows who the killer is and I believe that's all I'm clear I'm done yes
