 So the episode begins with Grace walking around the outside building where Alana was murdered, where night she's captured on a couple security cameras, which is then presented in the next scene when she meets with her family lawyer, like Haley was named, to discuss her role in the upcoming proceedings. Grace says she's going for a walk to keep herself grounded to clear her head, and her lawyer says this is not going to look, but all of the evidence at the moment clearly points to Jonathan, her husband, and not to her, but they believe that Grace is withholding information, and her lawyer calls her out on, you know, being a rich person who withholding information just to keep her family's head as well. Going into the next scene, I believe this time is when we... Yes, it's when Jonathan meets up with a lawyer, and she discusses, you know, what's happening, she's going to get him off of a $2 million bail, and but she begins asking questions, like, with a lot of the only woman that she handle very well with, and Jonathan then says, after a brief moment of silence, and hesitating in the lawyer saying that she will find out even if she's not felting, she... he then says that there was another woman a couple years back that slept with him as a comfort after he had lost a patient, it cuts from there, with a brief moment on both him and the lawyer, from there it was... Yes, it was Grace meeting with her father to discuss the $2 million bail, he is hesitant to do so, and then we get the next scene where he actually goes to... No, I spoke out of order, I believe the next scene to happen is actually when their son Henry, once into Miguel, he was running into the classroom building very terribly, that school building, and I was in classroom, he bumps into Miguel, is a very awkward moment, Miguel does not speak, Henry says, I'm sorry, I, before running off again, then goes to a scene with Henry, I believe it is, Dean or his principal office discussing what just happened, and he's, the principal asked what happened, he's recaltered happened, he ran into him, he said hello, I'm sorry, before I'm all my off, the next scene is actually the scene where Grace asks her father Franklin for $2 million bail, they discuss, he discusses how he feels about Jonathan before the scene cuts to Jonathan, not John, Franklin walking up to the prison, people getting on the prison bus, Franklin comes into the presentation visit, we're visiting one and talks with Jonathan, they discuss, he discusses that his wife thinks he's innocent, his wife can grace, but Franklin does not think he is innocent, he says if he lets him out on bail, and if anything happens, he tries to run, do anything else, he will kill himself, Franklin will kill him, actually going back to the visitation scene with the lawyer, I just remembered that, he had mentioned he had a police officer, he had got a punch in the face, that's where the boys came from, after Jonathan agrees, later back in the scene Franklin, after they have that moment, he says that he won't run, he won't do anything else, he will stay in this ground, Franklin looks shaken before he says he's ready to leave, he has to go to the camera, I believe the next scene that happened is Franklin, Jonathan is for least, he and him and his wife and his lawyer are sworn by reporters, howling over the detention center, he says someone along the line, so I'm happy to be free, I'm looking forward to clearing my name and myself in the court, after that scene was, I believe it was, I believe yes it was Grace walking in the park, cleaned her head and Alana's husband, his name escapes me at the moment, was walking in the park with her, not directly with her, but often a distance, now the next scene was actually Franklin and Grace sitting in their living room at Franklin's house, before the police come back and ask more questions, they use Grace knowing Alana how well we have to do each other, it's just phone calls, they may or may not have had, before they show Grace, oil painting they found in the basement of their woman's house, which shows a highly detailed oil painting, Grace should be flustered and then the scene ends, after that it goes to the walking scene with Grace, Alana's husband, I don't forget his name, but they walk, he sees her and then they go in a separate ways, the next scene is Grace walking through the park during daytime, the scene was early morning, probably about 7 am, probably like 6 o'clock, the next scene has her walking around, very dais confused, she is standing by a group of kids, just playing around, before one comes up in her vision, she stays at her place, she's no flake falling down to her hand, before she collapsed and is surrounded by kids, the next scene is Franklin and Henry going to her hospital bed to discuss which is having to make sure she's okay, before Jonathan runs in a few months later, he comes in, the scene is very awkward, it is very awkward scene, before he then goes to check up on her himself, he chumps flashlights up and her eyes did some basic touch my finger, it was back to my finger, that kind of stuff, before they hold hands, nice scene while Franklin is obviously raised by that, the next scene I believe is, I believe the next scene is, Jonathan meeting with all of his husband, and Miguel who is also his patient for Miguel's cancer treatment, he knocks him door, tries to bring himself in, the husband of the opposite, he has an end, he looks and killer, before he finally lets Jonathan in, Jonathan walks into Miguel, places his hand on the sheet and say, well, he goes, you're strong, Miguel I think he begins to cry before his father forces him back in his room, Jonathan and the husband begin talking again, they begin, Jonathan begins to plea to him, I do not kill her, that something terrible has happened, she keeps an eye on my wife, my wife being grace, from there he follows his husband into a living room where a child is a baby is crying, and we then find out that his child, but actually Jonathan and Alana's child, he begins to pick her up and hold her and then he stops crying before he ends up having to jump in with a bottle of milk for her to drink from, he holds her in the husband as, have you hold held her before he says yes, Miguel, not Miguel, sorry, the husband begins to discuss how much he really wants to love her, for the child, but it's hard, and he just knows how to handle it, and Jonathan is like, I can take her off your hands if that makes him too easy for her, then it cuts to the lawyer's office with him being yelled at, but you can't do this, you can't handle what he gives, it's with tamper with witnesses, he's like, I'm not, I was trying to tamper with him when I was, I've run him to understand, they have a confrontation about it with both the lawyer and Jonathan, you know, the staring face to face, the tension is there, they stare at each other before he says, did I pass the test, she says yes, barely, they then begin to discuss a plan while assistant, I assume comes in, drops off coffee, and the lawyer brings up the idea of, what if you go on television, have an interview, tell your son's story, and work your charm on them, the next thing I believe is, Greece in Franklin, chess, late in the evening, Greece says, I had Franklin says, I know something on the lines of, I know you, one of the relationship, Franklin and her mother had, but he then begins to say that, I've been, I was on faithful, and I gave your mother some of their gifts, so much love, hopefully have some kind of repentance for what he had done to her, and he says that's why he is super fond of Jonathan, because he aligns him so much of himself with Greece's mother, and he doesn't want someone like that to have Greece, then slams over chess pieces off of tables, you know, how we do think I am, as she starts off, we see Henry standing in, I guess the doorway I believe, the hole on the left of the bed, and the next scene is, I believe the final one with him being interviewed, with that he's, him and his lawyer are on a television show, I don't believe you're talking about, but he goes on the, the lawyer won't introduce his thing, and they talk about his side of the story, he's like, I'm covered with grief, I ran to the house to see her and found her like that, and the scus is said, he was in medical, like in medical terms, like he was in shock, and that he just ran because he believed that he was the cause of the murder, without actually murdering her, during this time we also see that his family, Henry, Grace, Frank, I believe her sister, the woman who's blonde and her child, and we see them watching this, as he goes on to say that he believes that was killed, you know, I live with a fifth of jealousy and rage, at this point we cut to, along with his husband and her holding the child, and we believe to think that Jonathan is referencing her, a hymn, sorry, but as the few girls on, talked about guilt, grief, and how he loved the woman, and the scene slowly, you know, got more and more to, in implying Grace as the murderer instead of either himself or a long husband, he, for the scene, ends, I'm trying to put something else, but I believe that is as much of the episode I remember, I am done, I'm done. Good.
