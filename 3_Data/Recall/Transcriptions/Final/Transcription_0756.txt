So basically the episode started with a stark scene of the city with the main character, um, what's her name. She starts to walk through the city and she seems contemplative and then the scene cuts to her talking to her new lawyer and it's implied that she's never met the lawyer before, um, and- err- umm- or she's met her recently and she's talking about how she took a walk at night but then her lawyer was like that's kind of shady because, um, why did you take a walk at night and she was like, she was contemplating and thinking and the lawyer was like taking it seriously and the lawyer was like, um, she said something about rich people being entitled but she actually had photos of her walking around at night, um, in her file so the walking around probably didn't take the night before that and she was like, uh, the main character isn't a police suspect anymore but they're still withholding and then I don't remember much of the first half because I was falling asleep, um, uh, and then she went to her house which is rich and she had a discussion with someone who looked like her father which was implied because she said that she needed like unconditional support from her father and there was a maid who was concerned about her which implies that they've known each other for a lot of time and then the main character, said no, its fine and then the Henry, which is the main character's son bumped into the victim's son in school and then he apologized to him, um, and then the son got sent to the principal's office for that reason and he was like quite clever with his response he, uh, the principal questioned him asking like what did he say after bumping into the victim's son and so he was probably called in because other people were like gossiping but Henry was like, um, I didn't do anything because it's my code of conduct or something like that which it- says a lot about his character. Um ... and, uh, there was, uh, someone who looks, someone who was acting like the main character's best friend who was at, um, her daughter's like, ballerina recital and it was this scene where they were packing up, uh, and then the, the best friend was asking- oh right, the second half was when she got a panic attack in the park but she was on one of her contemplating walks and she made eye contact with like these two children and then they rushed to see how she was doing and she was just lying on the grass uninjured and there were like birds flying and stuff yeah and then she woke up in a hospital and then Jonathan came rushing in like, I acting like a good ex-husband, and then they started flirting with each other for no reason and he was saying like doctor and he wanted her to open her eyes and like he had like a flashlight with him and he was doing like the finger movement to see if she could like track his finger movement and her father and her son were not having it like they were eyeing him suspiciously like, uh he's like, uh Jonathan is trying to win her over again especially when they had, uh like her the main character and her father had that like night chess play where she was like uh, you and mom had like a really good marriage because you like donned her with jewelry and used to buy her a lot of gifts and made her feel loved and cherished but then it reveals that the, the dad reveals himself that he was extremely unfaithful, um to her mom in the past and that her mom didn't like actually wear any of the jewelry because like he confessed to her in the past as he was unfaithful so he said, uh that's probably the reason why he did it- why she didn't wear the jewelry and he talked about how it was tainted or poison or something and this really shocked the daughter and then it goes on to reveal tha- and then the father was like that's why I don't like Jonathan because he reminds me of me and then the mother, and then the daughter was like shocked and um and offended that uh the father would think that she would be that weak that he would try to win her over and there was a scene where Jonathan went to the victims-uh husband's house and it turns out that he was a single father of two and he had like a baby that was definitely an illegitimate child of Jonathan and Elena and um he was acting like really innocent and he would affirm the husband that he didn't kill her but the husband didn't believe her at first but then he eventually let Jonathan in so then they nursed his illegitimate baby and the husband was like it's kind of hard to love this baby which is how I got the inference uh and then Jonathan offered to take the baby away from him so he wouldn't have to shoulder it and then he also saw like the picture of Elena like the small picture of Elena on the wall where she was like looking hot and uh I don't know like the point of that because that seems unusual, um and then uh after her-the daughter, after the main character's like panic attack she got a call from her best friend who was blonde and her daughter was like packing up from, from ballerina practice and she was acting like uh she was like being concerned about her best friend's uh like, well being and it's also revealed in the show that she used to be a clinical psychologist so she knows some stuff about like the brain and she also talks to like one of her friends in a diner which I don't remember who that person is but he was saying, he was like uh, giving her advice or something and then cut to- cut back to like the best friend phone call she was like how are you doing and the main character kept telling her she was fine even though she doesn't look fine she just looks contemplative again and then Jonathan keeps like uh, after Jonathan left the husband's house it cuts to the scene where he's talking to this same lawyer who apparently is representing this entire family so she probably knows like the main character's father and the main character's father was like she not supposed to be like funny or likeable, she's supposed to like solve your problems and then the lawyer was like calling Jonathan out for going to- her huh- going to Elena's husband's house to try to convince him that he's innocent which makes uh, which makes like the innocence of Jonathan a lot less definitive because it's framed in a way that's uh, like he's using his charms, like the lawyer's words, he's using his charms and good looks to try to win everyone over including the lawyer and they had this moment of eye contact where it's clear that they have like some kind of personal history that we don't know of and then he like, ah- questioned her about like how his acting was and then they broke eye contact and then it cuts to the scene where the lawyer and his uh, the lawyer accompanies him to a television show where the host said that the public really wants to know the truth of this like murder so that's where we know where the uh, the public uh, is like the murder is really publicized and he gets invited to a show host even though he was in jail like in the first half of the episode and apparently he got decked by someone in prison which we don't know why but it's like put in casually so back to the show host the main character's uh, uh, father, her and her son and her best friend and her best friend's daughter were all sitting in the living room looking at this uh, talk show and Jonathan talks about how he's like guilty in that, he's, in he was, in uh he was committed adultery in the past but he's not guilty in the sense that he, contr- like he- he said he may have contributed to Elena's murder but he definitely didn't commit the murder himself under his hand and then, when he said that there, this may have been like an act of jealousy and then it cuts to the scene where Elena's husband was also watching this live show, it sounded like he was trying to guilt her Elena's husband instead, and then the host asked if he had any idea who could have committed the murder and he stared at the camera after like having a little silent like crying moment and he said yes which is the cliffhanger of the episode and then the episode ends I'm done
