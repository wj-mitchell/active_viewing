So, what I remember was, um, the meeting between Grace the main charcater with the lawyer, the lawyer's name was Jonathan. So, he was talking with the lawyer about some things that, uh, either the lawyer or Grace was convinced that Jonathan killed the woman. And they were having [argument] between Jonathan. Um, I don't remember much of the first episode, but, uh, I think, well, John had made up with the husband of the dead woman and they had an argument because their son was in the room. They didn't want him to hear so, they escort him out. Uh, the husband of the dead woman was really angry, uh, as to why Jonathan would be the father. Uh, yeah, right. On to the next episode it was, uh, like, uh, like John had asked, uh, for some reason also really, uh, [his] dad, his son killed the woman and, uh, convinced Grace to also believe it. Right. Uh, then there was a, um, a meeting. Uh, there was, uh, a convention, uh, to meet between a lot of people. Um, Jonathan went with his, uh, wife. I think this is like, a memory or something. Um, the man who [UNCLEAR] the father and a lot of people just greeting John. Um, the context was not really clear but Jonathan seemed to be a very popular, uh, famous person. So, uh, he appeared on television, with his, uh, lawyer. Talked about, uh, the murder case and, uh, there he, he tried to, uh, defend uh, or defend himself that he was not, uh, the murderer. Uh, that he loved the woman and uh, uh, he mostly, almost [UNCLEAR- "mostly recount"?] Uh, he, he uh, he insisted on saying that he did not murder the, uh, woman. There was a scene that uh, John had a son. So his dad, so his dad was, uh, no, so his mom was talking with uh, with Jonathan the father and, or it was some, I didn't hear much but uh, well the son saw it and it was not, ... I think I'm done.
