So from what I remember, I remember the scene starting with the wife and the attorney talking and it seemed like the attorney was accusing the wife because the wife was out and she was out on the street or something, um, when the woman was murdered. So it made it seem like the attorney was accusing the wife of the murder, um, and from there I remember a lot of the, uh, the wife and her father talking a lot. So I think that's why I assumed more that, umm, it was either the mother or the grandfather who murdered the, um, the woman. But, um, so they had a lot of talk going back and forth and I remember seeing Jonathan in jail, um, and then he was let go and, um, I can't remember much more about the first part of the session. Um, but then in the second part of the session, I felt like I got to see more of about Jonathan and more of his innocence. So the reason why I was thinking that he was innocent because, um, he I know that he was a cheater 100% but he was unwilling to say that he murdered her. So, um, I thought that like I just believe that people tell the truth, um, most of the time but also I just kept on going back to how the grandfather and the mother, um, were having conversations about, [sighs] um different items and how the grandfather even said that he was a cheater and so it made him seem like he hasn't done the greatest things in his past and would do anything for his daughter's happiness. Um, and then the attorney was mad at Jonathan, um, but because Jonathan went to see the f-the man who was married to his lover, um, so the husband and when he did at first I thought like I felt Jonathan was becoming more guilty because he went to go see him in person, um, and the conversation seemed tense because the father was upset of course because he's accused, uh Jonathan is accused of his wife's murder, um, but later to come to find out that he was the father of the newborn baby and the other father was talking about how he its so hard to feel that he can care for this baby because it's Jonathan's child, um, so that was really tense but um an-another thing was when Jonathan like first came to the house the son was there and, um, the son was…uh he seemed on edge too because Jonathan was there cause I'm assuming that the child knows that Jonathan is accused of the murder but Jonathan walked up to him and touched his face to check in with him because that son does have cancer and he was his patient so I do feel like I'm missing the whole other part of the story where about the two sons where there was a scene from the first part with the two sons and how they go to school together and, uh, how the Jonathan’s son bumped into, um, the other boy uh-the-the woman's murdered who was murdered’s child and he was, the other boy didn't say anything but Jonathan’s son bumped into him and said sorry and then they had to go the principal's office and they talked about how Jonathan's son was going to be suspended because of, um, the news and how, um, it just wouldn't be right for his son to be in school the same school of his um of the woman's son was murdered, um, and then towards the end of the movie what happened uh…towards the end of the movie I believe that Jonathan was innocent, um, and it was left on a cliff hanger because Jonathan said that he wanted to go on the news and share his story and um so that people would believe him and so in the news when he was on the news with his attorney um or his lawyer um he talked about his innocence, um, and people were just like aren't you j-well the interviewer was like are you just doing this so you're more you you seem more like a victim and he was basically like no because I feel like I know who there's more of a motive from other people and I feel like I know who those people may be so it was left on a cliff hanger of um he knows who the murderer is but he does not want it he's not sure who it is so Billy should I still keep going…I'm sorry I'm literally horrible so storyteller so thanks
